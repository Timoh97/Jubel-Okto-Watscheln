# QUESTIONS: This repository contains answers to some of the Leetcode questions asked in interviews

## At the end of this README.md file, I have included links to resources that equip the learners with knowledge required to tackle software engineering interviews as well as improve their skills

### Debugging
- Use the rubber-Duck mode of debugging in case there are bugs in my code. Here is here to rubber-duck debugg
- Place a rubber duck or any other object on your desk.
- Explain your code to the object, line by line, in as much detail as possible.
- As you explain your code, you may often realize where the problem lies and how to fix it.
- If you don't find a solution, try re-reading your code or stepping through it using a debugger, and then explain the problem again to the object
- Repeat the process until you find a solution to the problem

This technique is often used by programmers because it forces you to slow down and think carefully about each line of code. By breaking down the code into smaller parts and explaining it in detail, you may spot errors or inconsistencies that you may have missed before.

In summary, the Rubber Duck Method is a useful technique for debugging code by explaining it in detail to an inanimate object. It's a simple but powerful technique that can help you overcome coding problems more effectively

As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
